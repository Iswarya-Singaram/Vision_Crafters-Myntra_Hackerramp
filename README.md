# Virtual Try-On Avatar Prototype

## Overview
This project is a prototype developed for the Implementation phase of the Myntra HackerRamp "We for She" hackathon. It aims to create an avatar from the user's body measurements, acting as a mannequin for virtual try-ons. This solution is designed to reduce return rates and increase user engagement on online shopping platforms.
