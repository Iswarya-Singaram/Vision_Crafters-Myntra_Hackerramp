<p align = "center"> A project for my internship at the VRLab, at University of Salerno </p>

<p> This project goal is to create a fully customizable 3D human body with your body measurements.
All that needs to be done is to enter the dimensions of the different body parts and it will generate a human body with those proportions for you.
The default body is generated with the measurements shown below. </p>
